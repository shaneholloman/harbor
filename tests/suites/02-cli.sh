# Suite: cli
#
# Exercises harbor CLI surface that does NOT require services to be running.
# These are the commands users hit constantly (config, ls, env, url, cmd, …)
# and they share code paths with install (env_manager, .env round-trip,
# profile merging) — so a regression here typically masks a portability bug.
#
# Why "non-container": this suite is fast (~1s on every row), runs with no
# docker traffic, and catches bash-portability bugs (the `tr '[:lower:]'`
# class) on every distro before we spend 30s booting mock-openai.
#
# Each step uses `assert_ok` to keep failures specific. We do NOT trap
# cleanup — the suite leaves the .env in its original state via paired
# set/unset round-trips and runs `harbor config update` last.

#    This is the exact path that contained the original `tr '[:lower:]'`
#    bug class (incident: hpme_vpuume), so we exercise dot-, dash-, and

# 7. cmd helper — prints the raw `docker compose ...` invocation Harbor
#    would run for the given service. Pure-bash, no container traffic.
#    `harbor url` is intentionally NOT tested here: it computes the URL

#    once the service is up — that path is exercised in the smoke suite.
